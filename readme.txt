== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is the export OK with my software ? =

WBK export format is quite universal, and most of softwares we know are compatible with the exported file. But you might need to change column headers or to do some minor changes.
Most of accounting softwares need you to chose an import format too, so you can configure it to exactly match with the file if you want.

If you encounter problems, we are openminded and we'de like to make our export more and more accurate so you can send us a CSV file from your software and we'll try to upgrade our plugin.

= Is Woocommerce Book Keeper compatible with Woocommerce refund system? =

Yes it is in the Pro version.

= Is Woocommerce Book Keeper compatible with invoices plugin? =

The free version is not, but with the Expert version can be used with Woocommerce PDF invoices and packing slips (CodeCanyon plugin).

= Is Woocommerce Book Keeper compatible with Woocommerce POS? =

Not really...yet, we're thinking about it... But it's quite a huge work to make it great.
As Woocommerce POS is using Woocommerce, you can still use our plugin but your accounting codes and cost centers will be the same as your online shop.

= How can I chose the account code and cost centers? =

You should ask your accountant or consult the general accounting plan for a good configuration. 
It's the most difficult part from this plugin, but when everything is OK, everything is rolling on ! B-)

= What gain can be expected from this plugin? =

If your setup is OK, you can dramatically improve your accounting entry and save a lot of time (and money). Even with the free version.
With the premium versions you can have more precise accounting analysis, and some pleasant feature that make your work even easier but this one is fine too ! :-)

= I don't need the Expert version but I'd like to help you, what should I do? =

Well it's easy, if this plugin makes your work easier, allows you to have a friday afternoon with your friends/family/dog, or lets you save some bucks, give us [5 stars here](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/woocommerce-book-keeper "Give us 5 Stars !") !
